# Architecture decision records

The load-bearing decisions and *why* they hold. One file each, in
[`decisions/`](decisions/) — this page is the router. Open the file whose
row matches; do not guess from the title alone. Supersede a decision by
writing a new ADR and changing the old one's `Status:` line, never by
deleting it.

**This file is generated. Do not edit it by hand.** Add a decision with
`python3 scripts/adr.py new "<title>" --topics a,b`, write the body,
then `python3 scripts/adr.py index`.

**Ids are minted, not chosen.** A new ADR is `YYYY-MM.suffix`
(`ADR 2026-08.k3f9`) with a random suffix, so parallel branches never take
the same number. Cite an ADR by its id, exactly as its heading spells it.
